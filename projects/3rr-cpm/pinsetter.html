    <h1>Pinsetter</h1>
    <img src="img/pinsetter.jpg"><br><br>
    Up to now, I have used 1/2" 18-8 stainless 7/0 taper pins <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/90681A001/">from McMaster-Carr</a> to assemble flexural mechanisms. These pins are relatively expensive at $0.65 ea, although they are generally reusable if I don't bang them up too much during installation. Another issue is length; they sit flush on either end in 1/2" aluminum plate, so a narrow punch is required for installation and removal. I can get longer 3/4" pins from McMaster for the same price, and the price drops by half if I switch to carbon steel, but another solution is to leverage the mechanical clock industry. They use brass taper pins by the bucketfull for precision assembly tasks, and 0.044" x 0.075" x 1" (i.e long 7/0) pins are only $0.08 each <a href="https://www.ronellclock.com/product/brass-taper-pins-choose-form-5-sizes/">from Ronell</a>. Installed finger-tight, they stick out a bit on each side:<br><br>
    <img src="img/brasspins.jpg"><br><br> 
    Sunk home with a hammer, they still stick out from both sides. I did notice that removed pins show a bit more wear than the stainless ones, since they're much softer, but even if these can't be reliably reused they're probably worthwhile. <br><br>
    Installing taper pins with a hammer is fun, but it's also imprecise and can easily damage flexures and frames. Worse, the method requires a perforated backup plate that provides clearance for the pin while keeping the flexure and the frame aligned. This is simple enough for small assemblies, but proved challenging when assembling the 9-flexure ~0.5 m 3-RRR compliant parallel manipulator. A simple hand tool that one can quickly align and squeeze to set pins would be nice; ideally, it would also function as a pin remover by simply flipping the tool 180 degrees. Building such a tool also opens the ever-tempting door to recursion; if the pinsetter itself used modular superelastic flexures as its pivots, it could be used to assemble "child" pinsetters given suitable parts and labor. <br><br>
    Alas, exponential pinsetters will remain elusive for the time being. As a quick test, I tried squeezing a taper pin home using a pair of channel-lock pliers. Since they (and most other pliers) don't maintain parallel jaws through their range of motion, the pin experiences significant off-axis forces which result in binding at the dovetail "ears", and in some cases, pin deformation:<br><br>
    <img src="img/bentpin.jpg"><br><br>
    As I've explored previously, using pivots to produce linear motion is possible but complex. Commercial parallel-jaw pliers (a delightfully useful tool) use a few pivots and two sliders. We have two pairs, so I took one set apart:<br><br>

    I sunk a handful of brass pins and found that I need a range of 4 to 9 mm above the 12.7 mm frame to both install and remove a pin. I measured a jaw from the disassembled pliers and modeled a modified version in CAD, increasing its opening range and including a rounded cutout for the pin. I cut the part on the wire-EDM (another delightfully useful tool) from a bar of 17-4; the first operation created the jaw profile with a mounting tang for the next cut: <br><br>

    ... and the second operation added the pin notch and brought the jaw to final dimension:<br><br>

    To save time and wire, I only ran the parts through the wire-EDM once; subsequent skim passes would have improved surface finish. Instead, I hit the part with a wire wheel to shine it up a bit:<br><br>

    Assembled and lubricated with a bit of lithium grease, the pinsetter works well for both assembly and disassembly:<br><br>

    It's not perfect; you can see the thin end of the brass taper pin bend a bit during disassembly in the video clip above. The parallel jaw pliers do a good enough job keeping the jaws parallel, but squeezing the joint together does translate both jaws a bit which must be carefully watched by the user to avoid binding. I found if I paid attention during disassembly it was quite reliable, but whenever I tried to demonstrate the system to someone (and often when I videotaped the process) I ended up bending a pin. Fortunately, assembly is quite a bit more reliable since the tool presses down on the thick end of the taper pin. Now that I have this tool, I can re-assemble the 3-RRR and continue calibration work. Or maybe find excuses to wire-EDM more things. <br><br>
