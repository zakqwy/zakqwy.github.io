    I spent a weekend building a Teensy 3.2-based prototype membrane potential visualizer for the NeuroBytes project. It ended up being one of the most important prototypes I’ve ever built – we got our best response from our customers, and its technical requirements drove our development efforts for the next few years. Survived in my bag before being retired when we switched from ATtiny88s to STM32L011s. I even built a second, slightly more compact version:
