    SLUDGE CRAFT is a joyful trash-to-treasure workflow which converts waste clay slip ("slop") and waste waterjet abrasive ("sludge") into a unique ceramic composite that is strong, abrasive, expressive, and laser-glaze-able. Janet Hollingsworth and Zach Fredin first studied this fascinating material at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, ME, as part of Haystack Labs 2025. Thank you to all the participants that contributed ideas, materials, and sculptures to the project! 
    <br>
    <h2>Make it!</h2>
    Do you have access to basic pottery equipment? Did your friend just get a waterjet cutter, and now has a tank full of waste abrasive they need to excavate? Are you excited about new artistic mediums that are also interesting engineering materials? Sounds like it is time for SLUDGE CRAFT!

    <br><br>
    <b>A note on safety!</b> Waterjet sludge is generally inert unless the machine has been used to cut toxic materials like copper-beryllium or lead. Ask your waterjet operator and steer clear if they have to treat their sludge as toxic waste. Beyond that, dry waterjet sludge is a dusty silicate, so wear a mask when handling the dry powder and clean up with a wet towel when you're done with a sludge fabrication session. The little treasures you find in the sludge, which are offcuts from machine operation, can occasionally be sharp, particularly if folks are using the waterjet to process glass. Wear normal workplace PPE when necessary, like close-toed shoes and safety glasses, and be careful around the hot kiln. Sludge is safe for pottery equipment (i.e., it won't damage kilns), but be careful not to mix it in with clay that folks may want to use for non sludge experiments.

    <br><br>
    <b>Find your work area.</b> You will want a few tables you can get messy with clay debris, and ideally, a spot in the sun to dry raw sludge and finished SLUDGE CRAFT items. A typical pottery workspace is perfect; just be sensitive about mixing sludge with non-sludge, and avoid sending the material through extruders or rollers without permission. Be a good studio steward: ask before moving someone else's project, and clean up when you're done.
    <br><br>
    <b>Prepare some sludge.</b> Ask your waterjet-owning-friend to let you scoop a few buckets out of their tank, then spread it out in the sun to dry (or, lacking sun, use a drying cabinet or a non-food-oven or a spare table for a week in a dry room). Remember treasures can be sharp, so be careful with this step.

    <br><br>
    Once the sludge is bone-dry and powdery (remember the mask!), use a block of wood to pulverize it. This helps with mixing later, and also gives you a chance to screen out treasures.

    <br><br>
    <b>Mix the sludge with waste slip at roughly 1:1 by mass.</b> Proportions aren't precise, since waste slip contains a variable amount of liquid, but we found 1:1 by mass gave us a good workable material without needing to add extra water. More sludge yielded crumbly material that didn't fire well, and less sludge used up less sludge, and we want to maximize sludge use! Start with 500g of each ingredient, which comes out to roughly the volume of a small Dixie cup. Plop the waste slip onto the screened dry sludge and start folding it together. Mixing starts out as a mess monster, akin to sticky pizza dough, but keep at it...

    <br><br>
    ... and eventually, you can treat the material like regular clay! At this point, wedge it on a table as you would normally before using it to build clay things. Add water as needed to avoid cracking and to stick things together and to generally make it friendly to work with.

    <br><br>
    <b>Once you've built your clay things, set them aside to dry for a bit.</b> We again used the sun to dry our SLUDGE CRAFT sculptures, but you can also use a drying cabinet. Or just set the kiln to pre-fire for a few hours; we ended up with a few squishy items and a 4-hr pre-fire at 200 F took care of them without cracking.

    <br><br>
    <b>Firing time!</b> If you have a test kiln, try a small run first to make sure you like the results. We fired our first run at Cone 7 (~2230 F), which is pretty far into the high fire range; at some point it would be neat to try bisque firing and glazing, but kiln cycles are limited in a 1-week charrette. We chose this temperature because it was low enough to avoid seriously over-firing any of the waste clays mixed into our slip. For our test run, we pre-fired at 200 F for 2 hours and then ramped at 500 F/hr to Cone 7, then shut the kiln off and started pulling samples out at ~300 F (which is why they were still a bit warm at the morning meeting). We later filled the mid-sized Bailey and fired it overnight; since some of those pieces were wetter, we pre-fired at 200 F for 4 hours and ramped a bit slower, at 350 F/hr. We suggest starting in this range and exploring from there. Let us know what settings you use, and how they work!

    <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
    Fab Labs, makerspaces, and community creation clubs are deeply important to us, but as facilitators and technicians we are keenly aware of the ongoing battle against waste. Laser cutters produce a constant stream of fussy offcuts; chop saws yield increasingly unusable stubs of dimensional lumber; 3D printers leave a trail of support material and test parts; the list goes on, and in our experience, is often invisible to community members. As we build out the new fabrication center at <a href="https://www.novoinkingston.org/the-metro-2025/">The Metro</a> in Kingston, NY, we are keen to push the waste needle towards awareness and reuse. 
    <br><br>
    SLUDGE CRAFT serves two purposes. The project itself, a joyful sprint through experimentation and craft during a brief visit to the Maine coast, tells a compelling story about reusing the waste produced by one of the key machines we are putting in the new space. But more broadly, the process we demonstrated at Haystack -- participatory experimentation, joyful tangents, active community participation, and a deep connection to craft and artistry -- will serve as a model for all the material reuse workshops we will hold in the future as we aim to render our trash cans obsolete.

    The experiments didn't stop after Labs 2025! Ah yes, we all have the SLUDGE CRAFT bug now. On the last day, Janet tried laser engraving a tile and ended up with the SLUDGE CRAFT logo shown at the top this page. We both hoped this would happen; during the flame test, the garnet melted down into a black obsidian-like lump, and we figured there was a chance the laser would vitrify the exposed garnet and produce an interesting result. Turns out it works INCREDIBLY WELL; we sometimes call it "self glazing tile" or "laser glazing", since you can just hit the material with a laser after firing. After returning to our respective homes, we continued to experiment on some of the extra SLUDGE CRAFT tiles we brought back.

    We also tried thermally treating tiles with an oxy-mapp torch. This produced the same vitrified surface as the laser treatment, albeit with far less precise control over the extent and depth of the glazing effect.

    <i>above, a flame-glazed tile after hot-imprinting with a metal punch. This tile subsequently broke after tapping on it with the punch after cool; we suspect repeated thermal cycling (it was torched twice) produced cracks that weakened the material. This tile also got heated red-hot and dropped in a cup of cold water, so that may have contributed to the failure as well. Next time we will make more tiles.</i>

    <h2>What comes next?</h2>
    Well, first, we'd love for <i>you</i> to try SLUDGE CRAFT. See the "Make it!" section, above, and show us what you create so we can link to your experiments! And second, we'd like to keep following the experimental rabbit holes. Of the many we've uncovered, a few stand out as potential next steps:
    <br><br>
    <b>mechanical tests:</b> proper instrumented 3-point bend tests of standardized samples so we can quantitatively compare different sludge process parameters, and see how this material compares to other ceramics and composites. We know it's incredibly strong; like, shockingly strong. You'll see, make some SLUDGE CRAFT. 
    <br><br>
    <b>parameter sweeps:</b> sludge-to-clay mix ratios; slip types (earthernware, stoneware, etc); firing parameters; drying time; etc.
    <br><br>
    <b>comparisons:</b> vs unused waterjet media; vs sand-and-clay; vs just clay; vs commercial tiles; vs frozen marshmallows; vs densified preforms (via pressing, etc); etc.
    <br><br>
    And we also want to write about this more, and probably run more workshops, and perhaps collaborate on some interesting SLUDGE CRAFT projects. So if you think this is interesting, get in touch!
