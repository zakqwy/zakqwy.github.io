    SLUDGE CRAFT is a joyful trash-to-treasure workflow which converts waste clay slip ("slop") and waste waterjet abrasive ("sludge") into a unique ceramic composite that is strong, abrasive, expressive, and laser-glaze-able. Janet Hollingsworth and Zach Fredin first studied this fascinating material at Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, ME, as part of Haystack Labs 2025. Thank you to all the participants that contributed ideas, materials, and sculptures to the project!

    <h2>Make it!</h2>
    Do you have access to basic pottery equipment? Did your friend just get a waterjet cutter, and now has a tank full of waste abrasive they need to excavate? Are you excited about new artistic mediums that are also interesting engineering materials? Sounds like it is time for SLUDGE CRAFT!

    <b>First, a note on safety!</b> Waterjet sludge is generally inert unless the machine has been used to cut toxic materials like copper-beryllium or lead. Ask your waterjet operator and steer clear if they have to treat their sludge as toxic waste. Beyond that, dry waterjet sludge is a dusty silicate, so wear a mask when handling the dry powder and clean up with a wet towel when you're done with a sludge fabrication session. The little "treasures" you find in the sludge, which are offcuts from machine operation, can occasionally be sharp, particularly if folks are using the waterjet to process glass. Wear normal workplace PPE when necessary, like close-toed shoes and safety glasses, and be careful around the hot kiln. Sludge is safe for pottery equipment (i.e., it won't damage kilns), but be careful not to mix it in with clay that folks may want to use for non sludge experiments.
    <br><br>
    <b>Second, find your work area.</b> You will want a few tables you can get messy with clay debris, and ideally, a spot in the sun to dry raw sludge and finished SLUDGE CRAFT items.
