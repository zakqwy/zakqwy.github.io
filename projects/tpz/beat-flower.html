    <h1>Beat Flower</h1>
    This colorful thing is a 12-sample soundboard with 6-sound polyphony and a radial user interface which surrounds a speaker:<br><br>
    <img src="img/beat-flower_finished.jpg"><br><br> 
    The microcontroller, a Teensy 4.0 with an audio module, is loaded with various drum clips. One of the seven buttons acts as a shift key for the other six, allowing the user to alternate between sample sets. The default set has several drums of various pitches and types along with a "clap" sound. The shift set has other percussive sounds, like cymbals and beeps. Gus had a great suggestion: intersperse drums and cymbals so each mode is more like a set and can be played reasonably! Alas, I ran short on time to re-flash the processor. But that shouldn't be too difficult to do in the future. Until then, here is a brief clip that can be right clicked to unmute:<br><br>

                Your browser does not support the video tag.

        </div>
    </div><br>
    Do not forget to re-mute the clip or it will get quite annoying.

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    Works. Plug in to charging port via USB-C jack on amplifier board. Turn on using switch on amplifier board. Press flower petals. Yellow is shift key. Adjust volume using knob on amplifier board. Note battery! Be careful with conductive things around PCBs to avoid shorting.
