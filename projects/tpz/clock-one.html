    <h1>Clock One</h1>
    <img src="img/clock-one_finished.jpg"><br><br>
    I wanted to build my first clock as quickly as possible while still waking up a few interesting fabrication processes. I decided to spin a custom printed circuit board using the Bantam PCB mill, and designed the case in Fusion360 to be laser-cut out of 1/8" plywood. The board hosts a Microchip SAMD21G18 microcontroller running an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express bootloader, and can be reprogrammed via a USB-C port which also provides power to the clock during operation. The microcontroller talks via I2C to a Microchip MCP7940 realtime clock, which manages a 32.768 kHz quartz osillator and a coin-cell battery back-up. For the display, I hacked apart a convenient 1-meter spool of APA104 addressible LEDs, which are diffused by a bit of typing paper and controlled using the Arduino FastLED library.
    <h2>Files</h2>
    <a href=cad/clock-one-cad.zip>fabrication files</a> in *.dxf format <br>
    <a href=cad/clock-one-pcb.zip>PCB files</a> via KiCad 5.x, including symbols/footprints <br>
    <a href=firmware/clock-one.ino>Arduino firmware</a>, without RTC or button support <br>
    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    As of late March, basic clock functions work! It displays time, changes color once per minute, and knows to roll over minutes at :59 and hours at :23. I haven't implemented a clock setting function with the two onboard pushbuttons, so the easiest way to set the time is to plug the clock in at 16:48, its hardcoded power-on setpoint. I also haven't written a driver for the RTC, so the clock uses the built-in SAMD21 RC oscillator and Arduino millis() function, losing a somewhat pathetic ~half hour per day. But for now, it illustrates the concept I hoped to get across and I'm excited to work on other things.
