    An exploration into the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board#Cordwood_construction">cordwood construction</a>, implemented as a wearable blinky ring powered by tiny zinc-air hearing aide batteries. Soon after releasing the source files a number of other hobbyists started building their own rings, and I was recently paid to supply ten ring kits as awards for a conference. On that note, get in touch if you won a kit and built it! Would be neat to see more cyborg rings in the wild.
