    After a few of our NeuroBytes boards failed the first round of ESD testing (shown above), I built an ESD pre-tester out of an eBay-sourced modular 8kV power supply, a few 100 pF capacitors, a bit of copper clad FR4, and a length of insulating Delrin rod. Most of the work involved building the circuit to trick the power supply into thinking it was in a mass spectrometer:
