# NeuroBytes
NeuroBytes (R) are electronic neuron simulators that help teach basic neuroscience at the high school and collegiate level. The product is [open-source](https://oshwa.org), modular, hands-on, and supported primarily through an SBIR grant from the National Science Foundation.

The NeuroBytes project led to the creation of NeuroTinker, LLC in April of 2015, and has been my full time job since the start of 2016. We have built roughly 1700 NeuroBytes to date spanning dozens of customer-driven iterations, and currently have another 5000 boards in production in Dongguan, China that represent our first five hundred commercially salable kits.

## Inspiration
Scientists and engineers have been building electronic neuron simulators for nearly a century, ever since the electrical characteristics of the giant squid axon were discovered and Otto Schmitt built his revolutionary Nerve Computer.

Since then, numerous teams have built electronic neuron simulators spanning a broad range of size and sophistication. While many of these devices succeeded in their research goals, they generally failed commercially due to high unit cost.

NeuroBytes differ from earlier designs primarily because it focused on minimizing cost from the start. We recognized that while each neural element must meet some minimal level of functionality, the real power of the simulation comes from modularity and flexibility; as such, each kit must contain as many devices as possible. This philosophy succeeds due to a convergence of favorable forces: the availability of low-cost high-feature microcontrollers; market acceptance of bare-PCB products such as Arduino and littleBits, allowing us to avoid expensive enclosures; and a willingness among customers to spend hundreds of dollars on sophisticated STEM education products.
