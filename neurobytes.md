# NeuroBytes
![NeuroBytes boards](/assets/img/neurobytes_boards.png "NeuroBytes boards")
NeuroBytes are electronic neuron simulators that help teach basic neuroscience at the high school and collegiate level. The product is [open-source](https://oshwa.org), modular, and supported primarily through an SBIR grant from the National Science Foundation. The NeuroBytes project led to the creation of NeuroTinker, LLC, and has been my full time job since the start of 2016. We have built roughly 1700 NeuroBytes to date spanning myriad iterations, and currently have another 5000 boards in production overseas.
