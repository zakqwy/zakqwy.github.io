A selection of personal electronics projects from the last few years, presented in no particular order.

## cyborg ring (2017-present)

![cyborg ring](/assets/img/cyborg-ring.gif "cyborg ring")

An exploration into the world of [cordwood construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board#Cordwood_construction), implemented as a wearable blinky ring powered by tiny zinc-air hearing aide batteries. Soon after releasing the source files a number of other hobbyists started building their own rings, and I was recently paid to supply ten ring kits as awards for a conference.

## TP-BMP (2017)

![TP-BMP PCBA](/assets/img/tp-bmp1.jpg "TP-BMP PCBA")

A PCB remix of the [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/frontpage/products/black-magic-probe), a terrific open-source JTAG debugger with an onboard GDB server. My verison replaces the thumbprint reader board in my Thinkpad and lets me program NeuroBytes (or pretty much any other ARM-based device) on the road.

## blinktronicator (2015-2016)

![blinktronicator](/assets/img/blinktronicator1.jpg "blinktronicator")

A USB dongle with all sixteen dominant wavelengths from the Rohm PicoLED series. Includes a mode that allows the user to turn on multiple LEDs at once at varied brightness levels to see which work well together. Used as a design guide for many subsequent projects, most recently the NeuroBytes [Network Interface Device](https://github.com/neurotinker/neurobytes_nid).
