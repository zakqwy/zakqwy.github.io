# Electronics
A selection of personal electronics projects from the last few years.

## cyborg ring (2017-present)

![cyborg ring](/assets/img/cyborg-ring.gif "cyborg ring")

An exploration into the world of [cordwood construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board#Cordwood_construction), implemented as a wearable blinky ring powered by tiny zinc-air hearing aide batteries. Soon after releasing the source files a number of other hobbyists started building their own rings, and I was recently paid to supply ten ring kits as awards for a conference. [Certified Open Hardware](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000141.html).

## TP-BMP (2017)

![TP-BMP PCBA](/assets/img/tp-bmp1.jpg "TP-BMP PCBA")

A PCB remix of the [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/frontpage/products/black-magic-probe), a terrific open-source JTAG debugger with an onboard GDB server. My verison replaces the thumbprint reader board in my Thinkpad X220 and lets me program NeuroBytes (or pretty much any other ARM-based device) on the road.

## blinktronicator (2015-2016)

![blinktronicator](/assets/img/blinktronicator1.jpg "blinktronicator")

A USB dongle with all sixteen dominant wavelengths from the Rohm PicoLED series. Includes a mode that allows the user to turn on multiple LEDs at once at varied brightness levels to see which work well together. Used as a design guide for many subsequent projects, most recently the NeuroBytes [Network Interface Device](https://github.com/neurotinker/neurobytes_nid). Received an [Honorable Mention](https://hackaday.com/2016/01/13/the-best-projects-that-fit-in-a-square-inch/) in the 2015 Hackday Square Inch Contest.

## Rotovis-Mod1 (2017-2018)

![rotovis1](/assets/img/rotovis1.png)

A tiny castellated board designed to help designers build high-DPI persistence-of-vision displays. DIP8-sized with 16 LEDs and a driver chip, allowing TI-83 resolution (40 DPI) with 8-bit greyscale. Led to development of a [novel dual-stencil technique](https://hackaday.io/project/27829-rotovis-mod1/log/70110-building-these-boards-is-its-own-special-brand-of-hell) for hand-assembling closely spaced 0201 LEDs. [Runner Up](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/18/packing-a-lot-into-a-little-pcb-winners-of-the-square-inch-project/), 2018 Hackaday Square Inch Contest.

## Phonetroller II (2018-present)

![phonetrollerII_1](/assets/img/phonetroller1II_1.jpg)

I chopped an XBOX360 wireless controller in half, bolted on a bunch of carved up FR4, wired in a Teensy 3.2 with a USB-C plug, and fitted it to my phone. Boom, Nintendo Switch without the DRM.

![phonetrollerII_2](/assets/img/phonetrollerII_2.jpg)

This project is still very much in progress. The next step is to design a kit that encourages a user to chop _their_ old game controller (XBOX or otherwise) in half, and provides replacement PCBs that mate up with the factory "ergonomics package" from the original device. During assembly, the user would customize the exact dimensions of the structure to snugly fit their device. Less E-waste, more upcycling, funner mobile gaming.

[Version One (bodgy)](https://hackaday.io/project/8160-weekend-novelty-projects/log/69162-phonetroller), [Version Two (slightly less bodgy)](https://hackaday.io/project/112177-phonetroller)
